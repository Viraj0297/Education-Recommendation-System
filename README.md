# Education-Recommendation-System
The Education Recommendation System is a web app that provides personalized study recommendations for students. Utilizing machine learning and web technologies, it analyzes academic performance and extracurricular activities to help students make informed educational decisions.

## Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that recommends optimal studies or career paths, leveraging various input factors such as academic scores, self-study hours, and extracurricular involvement.

## Technologies and Skills Applied
- **Machine Learning:**
  - Implemented a **Random Forest classifier** to predict study recommendations, achieving an impressive model accuracy of **85.25%**.
  - Conducted thorough data preprocessing using **scikit-learn**, including feature scaling and encoding of categorical variables.

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Utilized Python libraries like **NumPy** and **Pandas** for effective data handling and cleaning.
  - Scaled numeric features and encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, part-time job) to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.

- **Web Development:**
  - Developed a user-friendly web interface using **Flask**, allowing users to input their data through an interactive form.
  - Designed dynamic web pages using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap** for an improved user experience.

- **Recommendation System:**
  - Built a recommendation engine that outputs the top three most relevant study paths, displaying their associated probabilities.

## Project Execution
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, scikit-learn
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Deployment:** A fully functional Flask web application that interacts with users in real-time.
